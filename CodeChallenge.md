# React Native Coding Challenge

## 1. Goal

Your goal is to build a react native app that displays a list of restaurants for an inputted address. We will provide guidelines and feature requests below, but ultimately the design and functionality of your app is up to you. Keep in mind functionality and code quality is more important than asthetic design.

## 2. Instructions

Please read through the rest of the requirements and additional info before working on your app.

You can use third party libraries, but the more code you write yourself, the better.

You have 1 week to submit your code, however we want to be respectful of your time and do **not** expect you to work for more than **3 hours** on this challenge.

When you are finished please open a pull request.

## 3. Basic Requirements

#### Authentication
  * Create a form, which requires the user to enter the correct credentials to login. See `src/screens/SignIn/SignInContainer` for the required credentials.
  * Credentials should be validated and error messages should be displayed to the user.
  * Once the user has logged in, the `src/screens/AuthenticatedIndex` component should be rendered. This has already been implemented.
#### Displaying a List of Restaurants
  * Your app should have a text input that allows a user to enter an address in the format `"{street address}, {zip code}"`
  * Your app should fetch data on restaurants that deliver to that address, using the delivery.com API (see more below)
  * Your app should display these restaurants as a list, you can include whatever information about each restaurant you would like
  * Your app should run on iOS or Android

## 4. What We're Looking For
  * Typing: We love typescript and encourage you to type everything
  * Testing: We also love unit tests and encourage you to write tests for all scenarios
  * Clean code: Everyone loves clean code ðŸ¤“

## 5. Using the delivery.com API

You will be using a spoofed version of the delivery.com search API to fetch a list of restaurants. The URL looks like:

```
https://dcom-native-interview.s3.amazonaws.com/api/merchant/query/:address
```

Please use the address from the text input, remove any non-digit characters, and convert it to lowercased camel_case.

For example if a user types in "55 Water St, 10041" your GET request should look like this:

```
fetch('https://dcom-native-interview.s3.amazonaws.com/api/merchant/query/55_water_st_10041');
```

For simplicity please only use the following addresses:

 * 55 Water St, 10041
 * 240 Kent Ave, 11249
 * 232 Willow Ave, 07030
 * 245 E 63rd St, 10065

You can expect a json response that will contain a key called `merchants` with an array of merchant objects that look like:

```
{
  "id": number,
  "name": string,
  "logo_url": string,
  "url": {
      "complete": string
  },
  "ratings": {
      "overall_rating": number, // out of 100
      "star_rating": number, // out of 5 stars
      "num_ratings": number
  },
  "cuisines": string[],
  "price_rating": number, // out of 4
  "location": {
      "street": string,
      "state": string,
      "zip": string
  }
}
```
